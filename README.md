It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown.  
You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
Sometimes you want numbered list:  
1. One  
2. Two  
3. Three  

* Sometimes you want bullet Points  
- Dashes work just as well  
- and if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - like this

I want to write some code here: `arr1=arange(5)`  
or like this

```python  
for i in range(9):
    print(i)  
```  
Tasks lists:

- [x] a complete item
- [ ] another item

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
